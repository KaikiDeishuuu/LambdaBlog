```cpp
void ReverseList() {
    Node* prev = nullptr;
    Node* next = nullptr;
    Node* current = head_->next_;

    while (current != nullptr) {
        next = current->next_;
        current->next_ = prev;
        prev = current;
        current = next;
    }
    head_->next_ = prev;
}

void ReverseList2() {
    Node* current;
    Node* next;
    for (current = head_->next_, head_->next_ = nullptr; current != nullptr; current = next) {
        next = current->next_;
        current->next_ = head_->next_;
        head_->next_ = current;
    }
}
```
